# Stochastic-Wave-Function-Collapse

This is a repository for the warmup project of CS 7170 Seminars in AI: Proceedural Content Generation with ML. 

It is a stochastic version of the WFC algorithm which can be found here: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

This project uses the ASCII representation from the Super Mario Bros levels from the VGLC database.

Download the VGLC dataset to generate levels for other games: https://github.com/TheVGLC/TheVGLC 

To generate Levels: 
1. python main.py

To convert levels to image sets: 
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python text_to_image_level.py
